## Issue: Github Authentication Failure
**Date:** Nov 22, 2025
**Time:** 6:16PM
**Problem:** Couldn't git push using password
**Solution:** Reddit lists setting up SSH keys for secure authentication through Ubuntu Terminal.

## Issue: Operation Not supported!
**Date:** Nov 22, 2025
**Time:** 8:03PM 
**Problem:** Ran a test simply testing the authentication features, yet VM couldn't open without a GUI
**Solution:** Grab the link it provided, paste onto my home machine, and then it'll redirect me completing the test. 
**What I learned:** 
- Spotipy automatically runs a local server on port 8888 to catch the callback
- Spotify hates when I use localhost so for a redirect link always use the numerical version (127.0.0.1)
- VM and Host Machine can communicate through network ports even without a GUI
